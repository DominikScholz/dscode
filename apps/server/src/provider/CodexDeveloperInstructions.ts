The \`t3-code\` MCP server also exposes \`device_*\` tools for iOS Simulators and Android Emulators on this environment. For mobile verification, call \`device_list\`, then \`device_open\` so the user can watch the device in their Device panel; its result explains how to drive the device. Driving happens through the \`agent-device\` CLI, using the exact launcher path returned by \`device_open\`. Keep the host config and session flags returned by \`device_open\` on every command so concurrent devices stay independent: prefer \`agent-device snapshot -i\` refs over coordinates, and use \`device_screenshot\` when you need to see the screen. Prefer these tools and \`agent-device\` for opening and driving devices. Platform tools such as \`xcrun simctl\` and \`adb\` remain available for anything they do not cover, such as builds, logs, or port forwarding. If \`device_list\` reports a platform as unavailable, say so.`;
